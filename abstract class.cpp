/*
An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular implementation of that class.

The C++ interfaces are implemented using abstract classes and these abstract classes should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from associated data.

A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration as follows:
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Base class
class Shape
{
public:
   // pure virtual function providing interface framework.
   virtual int getArea() = 0;
   void setWidth(int w)
   {
      width = w;
   }
   void setHeight(int h)
   {
      height = h;
   }
protected:
   int width;
   int height;
};

// Derived classes
class Rectangle: public Shape
{
public:
   int getArea()
   {
      return (width * height);
   }
};
class Triangle: public Shape
{
public:
   int getArea()
   {
      return (width * height)/2;
   }
};

int main(void)
{
   Rectangle Rect;
   Triangle  Tri;

   Rect.setWidth(5);
   Rect.setHeight(7);
   // Print the area of the object.
   cout << "Total Rectangle area: " << Rect.getArea() << endl;

   Tri.setWidth(5);
   Tri.setHeight(7);
   // Print the area of the object.
   cout << "Total Triangle area: " << Tri.getArea() << endl;

   return 0;
}
